# Where to Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase

## Location Found! ✅

The email confirmation setting is located at:

**Authentication → Sign In / Providers**

In this section, look for:
- "Enable email confirmations" toggle/checkbox
- Or email verification settings
- Turn it OFF to disable email confirmation

This allows users to sign in immediately after creating an account without needing to verify their email first.

Perfect for development! You can re-enable it later for production.
